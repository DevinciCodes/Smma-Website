        <h2 class="purple-header">Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p>Not just another advertising agency…</p>
        <p>Believe us, if we made just $1 every time a potential client told us that they’ve ‘worked with an agency previously but the results were terrible’… Elon would be sat at the number 2 spot on Forbes’ richest list.</p>
        <p>We have heard your cries and we know how tired you are of all these “agencies” promising you the world and underdelivering.</p>
        <p>Which is why we are proud to present you; MCG Agency. – The worlds first Zero-Risk Advertising agency.

        </p>
        <p>The only agency skilled enough to not only guarantee results for your business but the only agency that can guarantee you’ll make a minimum of 20% profit on your advertising investment.</p>
        <p>This isn’t just advertising, it’s advertising the way it should be.</p>

        <p id="sub-header">What we specialise in</p>
        <h2>Just Paid Ads?!</h2>
        <p>Yup! – We only offer a single service to a single industry.</p>
        <p>That’s Facebook ads (including its audience network & Instagram) to the E-commerce industry.

        </p>
        <p>True mastery requires monastic focus & sacrifice.</p>
        <p>I would like to pose a simple, yet interesting question: Who is the greatest NBA player of all time?</p>
        <p>Really take a moment to think about it…</p>
        <p>You could have easily said Michael Jordan, Lebron James or Kobe Bryant etc. The list goes on.</p>
        <p>The fact is, there is no right or wrong answer. It’s actually a bit of a trick question because it all comes down to your own personal opinion and preference.</p>
        <p>But here’s the real question: What do all the greats have in common?</p>
        <p>Answer: They all stuck to just one thing. That’s it.</p>
        <p>It’s how anyone becomes the best at anything.</p>
        <p>Take Lebron James for instance. You either love him or hate him but there’s no denying he is one of the greatest of all time and has the rings to back that up.</p>
        <p>But do you see Lebron being world-class at basketball and swimming, or any other sport or thing for that matter?… No!</p>
        <p>It’s the same with advertising, to become world-class we’ve sacrificed everything else to focus on just paid traffic, namely Facebook and Instagram ads as those notoriously bring our clients the greatest ROI bar none.</p>
        <p>It’s the very reason why we are able to scale our clients to over $100k/pm profit whilst staying aggressively lean.</p>

        <h2 id="ad-copy">Demonstrating The Devastating Power Of "God-Like" Ad-Copy:</h2>
        <p>To further demonstrate and stress how important your ad-copy is, we’ll compare “God-like” ad-copy with “Okay-level” ad-copy.</p>
        <p>Let’s assume we have 2 different E-commerce business, both have a website conversion rate of 2%.</p>
        <p>Both have a CPM (cost per impression) of $10 with their Facebook ads, which is pretty average.</p>
        <p>‘Business A’ has a click-through rate (CTR) of 1%, whereas ‘Business B’ has a CTR of 1.5%.</p>
        <p>0.5% seems like such an insignificant difference but there are devastatingly-powerful, compunding effects that knock-on to all your other marketing metrics.</p>
        <p>Let’s take a closer look…</p>
        <p>For ‘Business A’: 1 in every 100 people click, which means their cost per click (CPC) is $1, whereas ‘Business B’ gets 1 in every 66 people to click their ads. Which means they have a CPC of 66 Cents.</p>
        <p>If each business has a 2% website conversion rate that means out of every 100 people to visit their store only 2 people buy or 1 in 50.</p>
        <p>That means for ‘Business A’ they need to spend $50 to acquire 1 new customer, whereas ‘Business B’ only needs to spend $33, which is $17 less!

        </p>
        <p>If you scale this to 1,000-10,000 orders a month, ‘Business B’ would be keeping an additional $17,000 to $170,000 a month in their pockets despite the fact they are spending the exact same amount on ads as ‘Business A’, simply due to the fact that they have had their ads written by an expert level copywriter, who took take their CTR from 1% to 1.5%</p>
        <p>At MarketLion, this sort of competitive advantage is shockingly-apparent to us and is one of the main reasons why we operate remotely as this allows us to scour the entire globe and hire the top 1% of the 1% of copywriting geniuses, which we have here at the agency.</p>
